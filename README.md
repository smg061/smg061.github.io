# Code Reformatting Homework

## This is the homepage for the Horiseon marketing firm, which includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.
The code for this page was reformatted to consolidate repetitive code that resulted from not using semantic tags in sections like the main article and the aside 
sections. Additionally alt attributes have been added to the images in this page to help meet accessibility requirements.
