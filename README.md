# Santos Gonzalez's Portfolio

## This is the homepage for my Portfolio of web apps. 
Displaying my work in an attractive website like this could attract potential employers.
This Web App contains responsive design for different resolution screens and mobile devices.
The App can be accessed through this [link](https://smg061.github.io/ "Homepage")

## Responsive design
The elements in this page shrink and grow with changing screen sizes and wrap around each other adaptively.


## Animations in navigation bar and links

This page implements attractive animations in response to mouse hovers. This makes the page feel more alive and responsive.


## Portfolio section with featured project

This page uses a flex container to display projects in a grid which will adapt to the screen size/resolution. Additionally, a featured project has been given emphasis by making 
it bigger and having it appear first.
